abstract = {Abstract The frontogenesis and frontolysis processes of the subpolar front (SPF) in the surface mixed layer of the Japan Sea are investigated using state-of-the-art oceanic reanalysis data. The SPF experiences a 9 month weakening period from January to September, which shifts to a strengthening period in October. Our analysis shows that horizontal advection consistently contributes to the intensification of the SPF. After September, as the weakening effect of surface heat flux diminishes, horizontal advection becomes the dominant factor that contributes to changes in the SPF strength. Thus, the SPF enters a 3 month strengthening period. The geostrophic component of horizontal advection provides the most important contribution to strengthening the SPF, acting to intensify the SPF year-round. Ekman advection also promotes SPF strengthening with a smaller but still important contribution. During the weakening period, SPF strength is largely controlled by heat flux. The heat flux, especially the shortwave radiation component, is the primary cause of the surface front disappearance in the summer.},

abstract = {Abstract The response of the subpolar front in the Sea of Japan (also known as the East Sea) to winter cyclones is investigated based on quantitative analyses of gridded and satellite data sets. Cyclone passages affecting the sea are detected using time series of spatially averaged surface turbulent heat fluxes. As the cyclones develop, there are strong cold-air outbreaks that produce twice the normal heat loss over the sea. After removal of sea surface temperature (SST) seasonal trends, we found that cyclone passage (hence, cooling) mainly occurred over 3 days, with maximum SST reduction of −0.4°C. The greatest reduction was found along the subpolar front, where frontal sharpness (i.e., SST gradient) increased by 0.1°C (100 km)−1. Results of a mixed-layer model were consistent with both temperature and frontal sharpness, and localized surface cooling along the subpolar front resulted from both horizontal heat advection and turbulent heat fluxes at the sea surface. Further analyses show that this localized cooling from horizontal heat advection is caused by the cross-frontal Ekman flow (vertically averaged over the mixed layer) and strong northwesterly winds associated with the cold-air outbreak during cyclone passage.},

abstract = {Abstract The effects of a cyclone-induced sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the Sea of Japan on following cyclones were investigated using a regional numerical model. The model was conducted with and without an SST anomaly due to cooling from a single extratropical cyclone in winter. Twenty-six pairs of sensitivity experiments demonstrated that cyclones were not always sensitive to the SST anomaly. The low-level trough (strong northwesterly winds) affected cyclone sensitivity via a cold air intrusion over the Sea of Japan. A strong (weak) cold air intrusion formed a relatively unstable (stable) and higher (lower) convective layer and the concentration of cyclone paths over the oceans, making the cyclones sensitive to the underlying SST. Two specific cyclones were analyzed to demonstrate two distinct patterns (wave-like and path shifting, respectively) in cyclone modulations revealed in the wavelet spectra. The wave-like pattern was formed by the superposition of multiple anomalous waves with different periods and scales, which originated from upper-level potential vorticity anomalies and temperature advection. The path-shifting pattern was caused by the diabatic heating-induced potential vorticity anomalies, which were supplied by the intense heat and moisture from the regions surrounding the Sea of Japan. Therefore, a cyclone can modulate a following cyclone by reducing the SST over the Sea of Japan; however, the modulation can vary in different ways, depending on the atmospheric background and dynamics of the cyclone development.},

abstract = {Abstract The importance of air-sea coupling in the simulation and prediction of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) has been well established. However, it remains unclear how air-sea coupling modulates the convection and related oceanic features on the subdaily scale. Based on a regional cloud-permitting coupled model, we evaluated the impact of the air-sea coupling on the convection during the convectively active phase of the MJO by varying the coupling frequency. The model successfully reproduced the atmospheric and oceanic variations observed by satellite and in situ measurements but with some quantitative biases. According to the sensitivity experiments, we found that stronger convection was mainly caused by the higher sea surface temperatures (SSTs) generated in high-frequency coupled experiments, especially when the coupling frequency was 1 hr or shorter. A lower coupling frequency would generate the phase lags in the diurnal cycle of SST and related turbulent heat fluxes. Our analyses further demonstrated that the phase-lagged diurnal cycle of SST suppressed deep convection through a decrease in daytime moistening in the lower troposphere. Meanwhile, in the upper ocean, the high-frequency air-sea coupling helped maintain the shallower mixed and isothermal layers by diurnal heating and cooling at the sea surface, which led to a higher mean SST. In contrast, the low-frequency coupled experiments underestimated the SST and therefore convective activities. Overall, our results demonstrated that high-frequency air-sea coupling (1 hr or shorter) could improve the reproducibility of the intensity and temporal variation in both diurnal convection and upper ocean processes.},
